## Rhymes

* You hear them buzz, you better run / pay attention or you'll get stung.

* Deep in the jungle, you hear them drumming / better run when they are coming.

* You hear their drums, it is too late / better hide and don't just wait.

* The earth quakes as you feel the rumble of the beast / keep moving, or you'll be its feast.

* Quick! Hide and close the door / for when you hear the lion roar.

* They look so nice and seem to flirt / though they are small, their bite does hurt.

* If you hear the thunder of their ride / it is the time to lose you pride.

* Impatience is for stupid men / a lesson you will soon all learn.

* Sweet she looks, the jungle's bride / but better men than you have died.

* Once there was an expedition / the jungle ended quick their mission.

* On your way you shall not stop / even when the rain will drop.
