## survival horror/SH demake

* Story:
  * small town, all around darknes (with eldritch things in the forest)
  * Wake up in a small hotel, no memories
  * Like Innsmouth...
* Goal: escape the town by finding a key to the boat or a car at the edge of town
* Dead: Constitution (HP, Sanity, something like that) runs out, Lights go out
* Playtime: 15-20min
* General
  * Fixed story about escaping this nightmare scenario
  * You can fight monsters, but better to run or only fight when necessary
* Mechanics
  * Batteries of your flashlight keep running out
    * Big FOV in the beginning
    * Lowers your FOV
    * Collect batteries to survive longer
    * When the light runs out -> you're dead :(
  * Journal with tipps (e.g. what item is needed to progress, e.g. spark-plug for a car)
  * 4 random weapons obtainable (weak, strong):
    * 2 melee, 2 ranged
    * limited ammo
      * calculated so that its not enough to kill all enemies (maybe 50% of all enemies?)
  * Constitution instead of HP
    * Few health pickups
  * Monster AI (can't make out what they are)
    * rats are random and attack when you are too near
    * ??? are slow & follow you
    * &$% are fast and jump at you
    * eldritch things -> cannot be killed, avoid at all costs
      * Instant death when they get you
      * First meeting: you don't die but escape and have to run
* Insanity effects (after a couple hundred of turns, 2 per game)
  * Tilt the canvas slightly from left to right
  * "It" appears
    * Wait who said that?
  * Transported to the backrooms for a couple of turns
  * Light flickering
  * Game glitches
  * UI starts to glitch/fade out


## Map Design
  * Points of interest in the Town
    * Supermarket
    * Church
    * Diner
    * Auto repair shop
    * School
    * Library

    * Random houses you can enter (with a zombie inside ;)
    * Town-Square (always in the middle)
  * Road goes through the forest from left to right, ends in darkness

F = Forest Room
